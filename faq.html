						<b>Q: What is this UP Hackathon?</b><br/>
						A: This is a programming competition! You will have 24 hours to work with a team to create a solution to certain business problems.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<b>Q: You mentioned this Hackathon was primarily geared towards web/mobile development. What if I'm not comfortable with either?</b><br/>
						A: While we would like to see web/mobile development, you are also welcome to work with hardware or create a backend application!
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: Can I still win this competition if I decide to create a hardware or backend solution?</b><br/>
						A: Of course! You are not required to create a web/mobile solution to win.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: What type of hardware will be available?</b><br/>
						A: We can provide your group with a Raspberry Pi, a cell modem and various sensors.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: What if I already have an Arduino/ other hardware and want to use this instead?</b><br/>
						A: Please feel free to bring this with you!
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: Who is eligible to participate?</b><br/>
						A: You must currently be an IT intern with UP.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: How many people can I have in a team?</b><br/>
						A: Each team may consist of up to 3 people max.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: Can I choose to work alone?</b><br/>
						A: Of course you can! However, with 24 hours this would not be advised.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: What if I want to compete but can't find a group?</b><br/>
						A: We can pair you up with others at the event.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: What problems will we be asked to solve?</b><br/>
						A: We will be providing business problems related to our theme 'Courage to Care' at the start of the event.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: What are the prizes again?</b><br/>
						A: Every individual on the winning teams will receive the following prizes:
					</p>
					<p>
							- 1st Place: Macbook Airs<br/>
							- 2nd Place: iPads<br/>
							- 3rd Place: $100 Amazon giftcards
					</p>
					<p>
							There will also be random prizes throughout the night just for attending.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: What if I'm not confident with my programming abilities?</b><br/>
						A: Keep in mind, everyone attending is an intern. Everyone should have roughly the same skill set. At the very least you'll get free food, a T-shirt, and a chance to win prizes!
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: 24 hours is a long time commitment. What if I don't want to stay up all night?</b><br/>
						A: You are welcome to bring a sleeping bag or go home to take a nap.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: Can I bring my own computer to the event?</b><br/>
						A: Yes! Not only do we allow it, we recommend it. It would be best if you for you to have your programming environment set up in advanced.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q: What if I don't have a computer to bring?</b><br/>
						A: Let us know and we'll provide you with a laptop to borrow.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q. How should I prepare?</b><br/>
						A. On the website, the section "Tips" outlines some technologies that would be interesting to use in your project. It is highly recommended to analyze safety in the railroad and where it can be improved upon.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Q. Can I bring my own snacks or drinks?</b><br/>
						A. Snacks and non-alcoholic beverages only, please. <b>UP has a strict no-alcohol policy. Do not come into the UPC building if you have consumed alcohol!</b>
